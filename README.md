register.com module for whmcs

Initial work,  not suitable for public use yet.

(c) Copyright Karl Gray 2014

This is a rough module for register.com API access for WHMCS
There is no error checking and minimal validation of incoming data as it is 
assumed that WHMCS will have pre-sanitised input before passing it to 
us.  Errors reported back from the registrar are passed to whmcs if 
available.
